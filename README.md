#Rails Projects Repo

This repo is where I save my small Ruby on Rails projects. Following the [The Odin Project's curriculum ](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails)

###Micro-Reddit

>Let's build Reddit. Well, maybe a very junior version of it called micro-reddit. In this project, you'll build the data structures necessary to support link submissions and commenting. We won't build a front end for it because we don't need to... you can use the Rails console to play around with models without the overhead of making HTTP requests and involving controllers or views.

This project focuses mainly on database and models associations. Setting up database migration and validate user inputs.


###Re-Former

>These projects will give you a chance to actually build some forms, both using nearly-pure HTML and then graduating to using the helper methods that Rails provides.

This project focuses on creating form, managing controllers and routers to handle user input forms.
