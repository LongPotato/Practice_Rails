#Rails Projects Repo

This repo is where I save my small Ruby on Rails projects. Following the [The Odin Project's curriculum ](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails)

###Micro-Reddit

>Let's build Reddit. Well, maybe a very junior version of it called micro-reddit. In this project, you'll build the data structures necessary to support link submissions and commenting. We won't build a front end for it because we don't need to... you can use the Rails console to play around with models without the overhead of making HTTP requests and involving controllers or views.

This project focuses mainly on database and models associations. Setting up database migration and validate user inputs.


###Re-Former

>These projects will give you a chance to actually build some forms, both using nearly-pure HTML and then graduating to using the helper methods that Rails provides.

This project focuses on creating form, managing controllers and routers to handle user input forms.


###Members-Only

>In this project, you'll be building an exclusive clubhouse where your members can write embarassing posts about non-members. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.

This project focuses on creating an authentication system: allow users to login and logout. The system stores cookies and display the view base on user's login status.


###Private-Events

 >You want to build a site similar to a private Eventbrite which allows users to create events and then manage user signups. Users can create events and send invitations and parties (sound familiar?). Events take place at a specific date and at a location (which you can just store as a string, like "Andy's House").

 This project focus on models, Active Records, associations. [View it live here](https://afternoon-reef-1518.herokuapp.com)
